### Data

Everything that generate data and Data is everywhere. <br/>
Your first Name, Mobile & everything inside it, Car generating data, Bank Finance Statements etc.

- Where do we store our data? <br/>
Personally we store our data in like Excels, spreadsheets, text files, etc.
So we store our data in different files. <br/>
Companies have a lot of things that generates a lot of data. Products they produces, customers, sales informations etc.
So, companies generate massive amount of data.

- How companies store and handle the data? <br/>
Of course, companies can't use simple file, They need something bigger, stronger and smarter.
Here, **Database** comes in the picture.

### Database 

It's like a container for storing the data. But instead of just dumping files into folders. 
The database organizes the data so it is easy to access, to manage and to search.

> Database is a container that stores data.

- Why we are using database? Can't we just use files like what we do personally. <br/>

Imagine someone asked that question, Go & find the total spending in your data.
So in order to find the total spending and costs, you will be opening each of those files one by one, searching for the cost, trying to combine the data.
It is very long and messy process.

On the other side if your data is in database and you want to ask question, It's going to be very easy.
All what you have to do is to talk to the database to ask a question and database will answer your question with a result.

## Why Learn SQL?

- How do we talk to a database? <br/>
We use **SQL**. ```SQL = Structured Query Language``` <br/>
SQL is the language that we use in order to talk to the database. <br/>
Some people call it **SeQueL** <br/>
Another reason why we use database is that Database can handle huge amount of data like in millions which can't be handle in spreadsheets. <br/>
Another reason is Database is just Secured, Saviour to store important and critical data and you can control who is accessing what. So It is just
more professional to store the data inside a database. <br/>

Most of the companies store their data in container called Database. In order to ask question and talk to database we have to speak the language of SQL.

## What is DMBS & SQL Server?

In companies, We have our data inside database, then there are multiple people with multiple roles that they're writing different SQLs in order to 
talk to database to get data. But not only employees and people interact with the database. <br/>

We could build a website and Application that as well interact with the database by sending different SQLs.
Depends on how many people are interaction with application and website, It might really massive amount of SQL that sent to the database. <br/>

Not only that we might have tools in order to do Data Visualizations like Dashboard, Reports etc created using PowerBI or Tableau used by stakeholders and
managers to make decisions. Those tools are also connected to the database and creating SQLs. <br/>

We can say, we have a lot of interactions with the database from Employees, Applications, Websites, Tools etc.
All of them are generating SQLs in order to interact with database. <br/>

But database is just a container/storage. So, We need something a software that manage all those requests that's why we have something called **DBMS**
```DBMS = Database Management System```. It is a software that is going to manage all those different requests to database and give priority which SQL must be 
executed first.

> **DBMS is the software that manages the database.**

Now we have **Data**, we have **Software (DBMS)** but what is missing here is the Hardware. <br/>
So, in real world companies, we can't run that on PC bcuz our PC is not capable enough and also it goes offline in case of powercut.
That's why we need a **Server**.

Server is like a very powerful PC and lives 24x7, always available. <br/>

We can decide whether we can have a Server inside a company or we can use Cloud Services in order to run our database.

- Summary 
   - Database : IT is container to store the data.
   - SQL : It is the language in order to talk to the database.
   - DBMS : It is the manager(Software), manages the database.
   - Server : It is a physical machine(Hardware) where the database lives.
