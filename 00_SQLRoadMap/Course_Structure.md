# Course Structure i.e. SQL Roadmap

## 1. Introduction to SQL

- What is SQL?
- Why Learn SQL?
- What is Database & Types
- SQL Commands
- SQL Components
- SQL Cosing Style
- Setup Environment

After theory

## 2. Query Data ( ```SELECT``` )

- SELECT
- FROM
- WHERE
- ORDER BY
- GROUP BY
- HAVING
- DISTINCT
- TOP
- Query Order & Execution

Once you understand How to create and get data out of database <br/>
Then next is How to define the database

## 3. Data Definition (DDL)

-   CREATE
-   ALTER
-   DROP

Next is learn about data manipulation

## 4. Data Manipulation (DML)

- INSERT
- UPDATE
- DELETE

Till here we learned the Basics Level <br/>

Next is Itermediate level

## 5. Filtering Data

- Comparison Operators
- Logical Operators
- BETWEEN
- IN
- LIKE

Apply all these operators to build a condition (Query) in order to get data <br/>

Next is very Interesting How to combine data

## 6. Combining Data

For combining the data, we have only 2 mechanism <br/>

- Joining Data
   - **Basic Joins**
      - INNER Join
      - LEFT Join
      - RIGHT Join
      - FULL Join
   - **Advanced Joins**
      - LEFT Anti Join
      - RIGHT Anti Join
      - FULL Anti Join
      - Cross Join
   - **How to choose the right Join?**
   - **How to Join multiple Tables?**
  
- SET Operators
  - UNION
  - UNION ALL
  - EXCEPT
  - INTERSECT 

So we learned How to combine multiple tables by combining that columns or rows of your tables.

Using SQL, we can do a lot of stuffs like Cleaning of data, a lot of data preparations and at the end do analytics and aggregations.
So, They are two family of functions 1st Row level functions and 2nd Data Analytics & Aggregation

## 7. Row-Level Functions

- String Functions
  - Transform your String values
- Number Functions
- Data & Time Functions
- Null Functions
  - How to handle Null is SQL?
- Case Statement

All of these are transformation of only one single value, we call it ***Row-Level Functions***.

> Row-Level Function is for Data Engineers.

After we learn Data Transformation then we have to learn about How to do Data Analytics and Aggregation using SQL Functions.

## 8. Aggregation & Analytical Functions

- Aggregate Functions
- Window Basics
- Window Aggregate Function
- Window Ranking Function
- Window Value Function

All of these are very important tool for any Data Analyst/Data Scientist for doing analytic tasks in SQL.

> Analytical Functions are for Data Analyst/Data Scientists.

Till here, We covered at Intermediate level.

## 9. Advanced SQL Techniques

Here, There are a lot of techniques to learn about SQL

- Subqueries
  - Query inside another Query
- CTE
  - Cammon Table Expression
- Views
  - How to create Views in Database?
  - This makes you profession in SQL
- CTAS Table & Temp Tables
- Stored Procedure
  - How to write a program in SQL?
- Triggers

All of these advanced techniques are used in Advanced Projects using SQL.

## 10. Performance Optimization

Once you learn all those concepts, and you start writing a lot of SQL Queries / Codes,
You will notice that some queries are going to be really slow and for that you have to learn 
How to optimised the performance of your queries?

Here, There are a lot of techniques. 
Most famous one is to create index in the database or create partitions etc.

- Indexes
- Partitions
- Performance Tips
  

## 11. AI & SQL

How to use AI like ChatGPT, Copilot in our SQL Projects?

How to write correct prompt to get assistance from AI?

## 12. SQL Projects

In hand projects where you get challenges, struggles and re-learning.

We will see 3 types of projects of real learning

- Data Warehousing Project
  - This is very Data Engineering focus project where we can learn How to build a real data warehouse where
    we can take data from row format then process it in different layers.
    
- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) Project
  - Here we're start exploring the data and start getting the first insights about a business.
    
- Advanced Data Analytics Project
